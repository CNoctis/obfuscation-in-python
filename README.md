# obfuscation-in-python
obfuscation program in python

This program intends to create a file with content previously loaded in a file called: "texto.txt"
and generate a file called: "texto_obfuscation "
which will be unreadable.
It will also create a file called:
"deobfuscation_text"
 Which is the fully legible text.
